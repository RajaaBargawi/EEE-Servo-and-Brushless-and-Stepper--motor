The brushless motor consists of two parts, an internal and an external 
First: the inner part of the brushless motor consists of several coils around which copper wires are wrapped, each coil connected to another coil opposite to it, and this part of the motor is fixed. 
Second: The outer part is usually rotating, and inside it there are a number of magnets, the number of which is equal to the number of coils in the other part, and these magnets are arranged in the order of one of them to the north and the other to the south.  
 for the way the brushless motor works, the motor rotates when the first signal is received in the first coil, and when the magnetic signal of the magnet matches the current in the coil, it will be repulsive, causing the coil to move to the place of the next coil, which leads to the opposite of the current in the next coil and its movement as well.  The current reversals in the coils continue in succession, causing the brushless motor to move in a rotating way. In other cases, the current is run in two coils to increase the torque
