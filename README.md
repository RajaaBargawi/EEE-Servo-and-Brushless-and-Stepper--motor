In this report, I designed an electrical circuit for three motors, namely, the brushless motor, the stepper motor, and the servo motor.
In addition, I wrote the work algorithms for each of the three motors with a simplified description of some of the motor components to simplify the understanding of the work algorithms.
but for the lack of availability  Brushless motor and stepper motor in tinkercad I used DC motor as an alternative.
