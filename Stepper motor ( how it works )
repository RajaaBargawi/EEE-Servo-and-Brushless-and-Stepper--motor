If we suppose that we have a motor of 4 coils, the motor will have 5 wires, one of them assembled, connected to the positive or negative pole
while the other 4 wires connect each of them with a pulse and then the next end with a pulse until the pulses of the four wires are completed and this method is in  The work in which the motorâ€™s accuracy is less, as it moves from one coil to another
and to increase the accuracy of the motor, we can connect a pulse to the first coil, then a pulse to the first and second coils together, then a pulse to the second coil, then a pulse to the second and third, then a pulse to the third, then a pulse to the third and fourth, then  A pulse for the fourth, then a pulse for the fourth, the first together, then the first, and so the motor is more accurate than the first method
